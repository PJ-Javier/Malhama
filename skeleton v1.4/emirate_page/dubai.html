      <h1>HISTORY OF DUBAI</h1>
      <p>Dubai’s livelihood, in the past, relied heavily on fishing, pearl diving, boat building, providing hospitality to traders passing through to trade gold, spices, and textiles. Today, these can be found in souks. </p>

      <p>Under the leadership of the Al Maktoum, Dubai was regarded as a fishing village. Despite the massive changes the emirate has undergone, its heritage can still be explored in the banks of Dubai Creek. The site is a hub of activity with abras and boats gliding along the historical waterways.</p>

      <p>Under the leadership, welcoming expatriates was in congruence to the thriving of the emirate. The huge influx in the number of foreign workers, Indian and Pakistani traders descended to the emirate, to take advantage of the excellent business conditions. During this period of success, it was still wholly reliant on fishing, pearl diving, and trading. </p>

      <p>In the 60’s, Dubai struck oil. From here on out the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum ensued the development of Dubai. Transforming the city from small settlement clusters near Dubai Creek to modern port, city and commercial hub.</p>
      
      <p>In the space of just half a century, Dubai exploded in growth, building a metropolis of ambitious architecture and social projects. At present, the emirate continues to plan projects to attract tourists and business alike.</p>
